   Hello. I'm Mack. I am currently a sophomore computer science student at Auburn, pursuing a certificate in AI and a Business of Engineering Tech minor. I am from Atlanta, graduating from Westminster in 2023. I want to pursue a career in tech and AI, aiming to discover a way to monetize it myself to make my own money. I want to work for myself.
   It's hard to convince me to work service or a 9-5 because I ran a business in recent years that saw five times the benefits as the former. My sports camp ran for 3 weeks each summer and one in the winter, taking 45-60 camper per session. With every camper paying 300$, it got pretty lucrative. 
   In running this I found skills in marketing, communication, and finance that I want to take into the tech world. I hope I can find my way in this extremeley competetive field. 

   As a person, I like to keep myself healthy and physical with a protein heavy diet and intense gym rountine, hangout and party with my friends/fraternity, play videogames with my little brother, and of course, I suffer from a minor addiction of instagram reels.
